# Supply-Chain-Optimization-BI-Dashboard
💭*Business Case*
➡️The company maintains invoice-level details of all vendors for each part procured. Generally, the procurement team receives invoice data from accounts for each vendor and collects supplier and part-level information separately from the purchase department. The agenda is to study the relevant data to identify procurement trends, supplier limitations, product-based supplier consolidation opportunities, and minimize cost impacts to the company.
💭*Problem Statement*
➡️The collected data is for multiple plants grouped by different business units, and the parts are either made of aluminum or ferrous of different raw material grade alloys, with the source being either a tier 1 or tier 2 supplier. Therefore, the needs is to create a dashboard that is insightful on all these factors and can help client make better supply chain strategic decisions.
